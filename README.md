#twitterBot

in order to make this program work, you will need to create an file called ''constants.txt' in the same directory where the project/node.js file is.
In that file you will past there the bot and twitter account codes by this order:


_______________________constants.txt________________________________________________________   
line 1: <consumer_key>                                                                      |
line 2: <consumer_secret>                                                                   |
line 3: <access_token>                                                                      |
line 4: <access_token_secret>                                                               |
